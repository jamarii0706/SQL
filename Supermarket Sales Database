/* This project is based off of a dataset which represents the historical record of sales data in 3 different 
supermarkets. It includes tables for the invoice id, branch, city, the customer type, 
gender, product line, the unit price, quantity, tax, the total, the date, the time of purchase, the payment 
type, the cost of goods sold, the gross margin percentage, the gross income, and the customer rating. */

/* 1. What are the total sales for each city? Which city has the most sales? */

SELECT city, ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS "Total"

/* 2. What is the quantity sold for each product line and what are the total sales made? */

SELECT productLine, SUM(quantity) AS "Total Bought", ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS "Total Sales"

/* 3. How do sales differ between member and non-member customers? */

SELECT customerType, ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS "Total Sales"
